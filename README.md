# blogzero - an anonymised blogging service

## the premise
Every user gets an ID and an OTP generator. Nothing more. You authenticate yourself with these two things. Target is maximum anonymity (as best as I can manage).

### vouching
You can invite others, but you will vouch for them with half of their ban period. If a user you have invited is permanently banned, your account will get the maximum punishment of 30 days. THis applies across all invite levels. Let's say you invited a wolf, who in turn invited a parrot. If the parrot gets banned for ten days, the wolf will be banned for five days and you will be banned for 2.5 days.

### why this concept?
I didn't want to deal with the whole password and 2fa charade of authentication. And I wanted to try out how hard it is to create true anonymity.

## why are you doing that?
I wanted to try out TOTP and I needed a project for my downtime at work.

## i have an idea!
Nice! Create an issue and tag it with "idea". I will look through them and discuss what's possible.
